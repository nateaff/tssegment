# tssegment  

This package provides two main functions: One for segmenting data and another for classifying time series based on a segmented time series. The classification method uses one or more classifiers to make to make a prediction weighted by segment length. 

```
segment(df, ts, features)

# S3 method for class formula
segmentModel(formula, data=NULL, ...)

segmentModel(x, y=NULL, xtest=NULL, ytest=NULL, ...)
```
